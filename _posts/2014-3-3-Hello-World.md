As you all know, this being my first post, I am way too excited about it. Writing a blog has always been in my bucket list and Iâ€™m finally living it. I hope something or the other makes sense to you.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
