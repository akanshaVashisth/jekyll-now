This being my first blog post and I am way too excited about it. Writing a blog has always been in my bucket list and Iâ€™m finally doing it. I hope something or the other makes sense to you. Stay tuned for some great stories from my data science journey.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
